The new map:
-100 longtitude and 100 latitude: 10000 pixels
-Have 4 main components:
  //act like a grid with area, not coordinate
  +<node id="123456"  lon="45"  lat="20">
00001   10000
  //the nodes will be on a same line and follow order from start to end
  +<way id=""  name="">
    <lane1>
      <nd ref="node_id">
      <nd ref="">
      <nd ref="">
    <lane2>
  //the nodes is the grids the building is on
  +<building id=""  name="" type="industrial/residental">
    <nd ref="node_id">
    <nd ref="">
    <nd ref="">

  +<intersection id=""  traffic_light="true">
    <nd ref="">
    <way id=""  name="">
    <way id=""  name="">


-The position of the car will be its current grid. When a car on a intersection grid, it will choose which way to turn by consider the 4 possibilities, while only 2(go ahead or turn back) if on the normal road.
  +car need a is_on_the_road(current_grid) function to predict its path
  +if is_on_intersection(current_grid) == true
  +if next_grid_empty(next_grid) == true
    if the car go on the same direction->false
    if the car on the opposite direction->true
